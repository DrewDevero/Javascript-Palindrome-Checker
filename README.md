# Javascript-Palindrome-Checker
This function allows one to check if any string, array, or number is a palindrome. I plan on cleaning it up, if possible, and making this scalable for multiple submissions of any string, array or number at one time.

*edit: As of 10/26/20, I've added/altered some code to express javascript array input results as text on the webpage with background color changes depending on whether an input is symmetrical or not. This functionality will be replicated using React so that inputs can be written in the input field on the webpage and have those inputs be checked for symmetry upon clicking the "Palindrome?" button as opposed to going through the updatable array currently being referenced in my javascript file.

*edit: As of 11/26/20, I've added functionality that allows for a user's input to be read and fed through my checker. So, now one can use the checker and get their results (results displayed on the page and logged in the console).
